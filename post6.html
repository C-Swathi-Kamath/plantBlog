        <h5 class="mb-3 fw-bolder">What to do with indooe plants when you are away on holidays</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Many of us are rightfully concerned about indoor plants maintenance. 
            That's usually a reason for not bringing any leafy plant inside the home;
             at most we allow a cacti or two, but that's generally it. 
             However, with the right tools and techniques, it has now become easier than ever to keep house plants alive and healthy while you're away, either for business or on holidays. Welcome to the smart gardening era! 
            </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Pre-requisite 1: make sure the plant's pot has drainage holes at the bottom to avoid damp that can create root rot.
            </p>
             <p class="mb-4">
                Pre-requisite 2: these tricks are for plants that actually need to be watered weekly. Cacti and Succulents can live for a month without water so no need to use the techniques below on them if you're away for a couple weeks only.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mb-3 fw-bolder">Water self absorbing tricks to use when you are away</h5>
        <ol>
            <li class="mb-3 fw-bolder">The garden twine trick</li>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Fill a bucket (or bin or pot or deep frying pan...) with tap water and place it on a table top. 
                That's going to be your water reservoir.
                 Cut several portions of garden twine (or wick) and prehumidify them by soaking them.
                  Place an end of each in the water reservoir. Stick the other end into the soil of your plant. 
                  Make sure that the water reservoir is elevated, so that the water can find its way down with the help of gravity. 
                  The garden twine will slowly conduct water to your plants by capillarity while you're working on your suntan. 
                  The longer you're away, the more water you'll need.
            </p>

            <li class="mb-3 fw-bolder">The damp towel trick</li>
            <p class="mb-4">
                lay a mob, a towel or a thick fibrous piece of linnen in a tray and humidify it.
                 Place your plant pot on top.
                  Add some water around if needed.
                   The idea is to create a humid zone as close to the roots as possible. 
                   The longer you're away, the more water you'll need.
            </p>

            <li class="mb-3 fw-bolder">Use self-watering pots</li>
            <p class="mb-4">
                You got it by now if you read this blog, I'm a big fan of self-watering pots because they are SO handy!
                 I've finally made a review of the Wet Pot, a beautiful yet simple self-watering pot   
            </p>
          </ol>

          <h5 class="mb-3 fw-bolder">Advantages of techniques #1 and #2:</h5>
          <p class="mb-4">
            they are easy and free. 
            I've done it the last few times we went on holidays and the results went beyond my expectations!
             No plant died and I found every single one of them alive and healthy when returning.
          </p>

          <h5 class="mb-3 fw-bolder">Advantages of technique #3:</h5>
          <p class="mb-4">
            self-watering pots will save you time and efforts.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4">
            Of course, you can also bring your plants to a friend, a relative or even your colleagues for free.
             Some plant shops even offer a plant maintenance service for a daily rate.
